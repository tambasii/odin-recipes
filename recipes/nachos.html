      As summer vacation comes to a close, let's make breakfast memorable while
      we still have lazy mornings to kick back and relax. This play on steak and
      eggs features tortilla chips loaded with your favorite nacho toppings,
      seared flat iron steak, scrambled eggs, and an herb-packed chimichurri
      sauce.
